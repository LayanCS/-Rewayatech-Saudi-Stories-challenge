# Team work:
During the Saudi Novel Challenge (Rewayatech Hackathon) we attempt to explore and analyze 1,267 online-published stories. Those stories were published in Arabic between the years 2003 – 2015 on various forums online. 

**Our work was divided into 5 smaller tasks, such as:**
  1.	Gathering the data (combine the novels and meta data into one data frame)
  2.	Assess the data (check for null values, duplicate data, and any other problem)
  3.	Clean the data (normalize the text, remove punctuation, remove diacritics, …)
  4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (vocabulary of most used words using “Word2Vec”, unsupervised analysis using “K-Means” and “PCA”)
  5.	Visualize and analyze the results(t-sne, bar plot)
