# Rewayatech-Saudi-Stories challenge
The challenge is about analyzing a collection of Arabic stories.
I participated as the leader of The Novelists team with my teammates [Layan Alabdullatef](https://github.com/LayanCS) and [Ghaida Altamimi](https://github.com/GMRT1)

# Data Description:
  A collection of Arabic stories written in electronic forms between the years of 2003-2015 by online users using anonymized usernames. The data is released for non-commercial research use. The total number of stories collected is 1,267 files, stories. In average, each story contains 73,798 words. These stories where written by 913 unique authors, with a minimum of one story per writer and a maximum of seven stories per author. Authors who authored more than one story usually have stories with multiple series. The data can be find at this [Link](https://github.com/aseelad/Rewayatech-Saudi-Stories)


# Team work:
During the Saudi Novel Challenge (Rewayatech Hackathon) we attempt to explore and analyze 1,267 online-published stories. Those stories were published in Arabic between the years 2003 – 2015 on various forums online. 

**Our work was divided into 5 smaller tasks, such as:**
  1.	Gathering the data (combine the novels and meta data into one data frame)
  2.	Assess the data (check for null values, duplicate data, and any other problem)
  3.	Clean the data (normalize the text, remove punctuation, remove diacritics, …)
  4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (vocabulary of most used words using “Word2Vec”, unsupervised analysis using “K-Means” and “PCA”)
  5.	Visualize and analyze the results(t-sne, bar plot) 

# Datasets
The data we are using are very large in size, there for you can find all csv files in this [Google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1id5e2XkTbT3roMQwmhYGjFnksR5hZYSy?usp=sharing)
